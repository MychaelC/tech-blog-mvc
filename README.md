# tech-blog-mvc
Tech-blog is a site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. The site is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The site uses MVC in its architectural structure, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
